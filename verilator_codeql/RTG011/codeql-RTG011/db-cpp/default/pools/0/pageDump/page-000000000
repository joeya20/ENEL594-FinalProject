   since version 4.9.  Previous versions do not provide generic
   selection, even though they might set __STDC_VERSION__ to 201112L,
   when in -std=c11 mode.  Thus, we must check for !defined __GNUC__
   when testing __STDC_VERSION__ for generic selection support.
   On the other hand, Clang also defines __GNUC__, so a clang-specific
   check is required to enable the use of generic selection.  *//* __glibc_macro_warning (MESSAGE) issues warning MESSAGE.  This is
   intended for use in preprocessor macros.

   Note: MESSAGE must be a _single_ string; concatenation of string
   literals is not supported.  *//* Copies attributes from the declaration or type referenced by
   the argument.  *//* Undefine (also defined in libc-symbols.h).  *//* Describes a char array whose address can safely be passed as the first
   argument to strncpy and strncat, as the char array is not necessarily
   a NUL-terminated string.  *//* Not supported.  *//* Some other non-C99 compiler.  *//* Not supported in old GCC.  *//* ISO C99 also allows to declare arrays as non-overlapping.  The syntax is
     array_name[restrict]
   GCC 3.1 supports this.  *//* Ignore *//* __restrict is known in EGCS 1.2 and above. *//* It is possible to compile containing GCC extensions even if GCC is
   run in pedantic mode if the uses are carefully marked using the
   `__extension__' keyword.  But this is not generally available before
   version 2.8.  *//* GCC 4.3 and above allow passing all anonymous arguments of an
   __extern_always_inline function to some other vararg function.  *//* GCC 4.3 and above with -std=c99 or -std=gnu99 implements ISO C99
   inline semantics, unless -fgnu89-inline is used.  Using __GNUC_STDC_INLINE__
   or __GNUC_GNU_INLINE is not a good enough check for gcc because gcc versions
   older than 4.3 may define these macros and still not guarantee GNU inlining
   semantics.

   clang++ identifies itself as gcc-4.2, but has support for GNU inlining
   semantics, that can be checked for by using the __GNUC_STDC_INLINE_ and
   __GNUC_GNU_INLINE__ macro definitions.  *//* Associate error messages with the source location of the call site rather
   than with the source location inside the function.  *//* The Linux kernel defines __always_inline in stddef.h (283d7573), and
   it conflicts with this definition.  Therefore undefine it first to
   allow either header to be included first.  *//* Forces a function to be always inlined.  *//* empty *//* If fortification mode, we warn about unused results of certain
   function calls which can lead to problems.  *//* The nonull function attribute allows to mark pointer parameters which
   must not be NULL.  *//* At some point during the gcc 2.97 development the `strfmon' format
   attribute for functions was introduced.  We don't want to use it
   unconditionally (although this would be possible) since it
   generates warnings.  *//* At some point during the gcc 2.8 development the `format_arg' attribute
   for functions was introduced.  We don't want to use it unconditionally
   (although this would be possible) since it generates warnings.
   If several `format_arg' attributes are given for the same function, in
   gcc-3.0 and older, all but the last one are ignored.  In newer gccs,
   all designated arguments are considered.  *//* Since version 4.5, gcc also allows one to specify the message printed
   when a deprecated function is used.  clang claims to be gcc 4.2, but
   may also support this feature.  *//* Since version 3.2, gcc allows marking deprecated functions.  *//* At some point during the gcc 3.1 development the `used' attribute
   for functions was introduced.  We don't want to use it unconditionally
   (although this would be possible) since it generates warnings.  *//* This declaration tells the compiler that the value is constant.  *//* At some point during the gcc 2.96 development the `pure' attribute
   for functions was introduced.  We don't want to use it unconditionally
   (although this would be possible) since it generates warnings.  *//* Ignore.  *//* Tell the compiler which arguments to an allocation function
   indicate the size of the allocation.  *//* At some point during the gcc 2.96 development the `malloc' attribute
   for functions was introduced.  We don't want to use it unconditionally
   (although this would be possible) since it generates warnings.  *//* GCC has various useful declarations that can be made with the
   `__attribute__' syntax.  All of the ways we use this do fine if
   they are omitted for compilers that don't understand it. *//*
#elif __SOME_OTHER_COMPILER__

# define __REDIRECT(name, proto, alias) name proto; \
	_Pragma("let " #name " = " #alias)
*//* __asm__ ("xyz") is used throughout the headers to rename functions
   at the assembly language level.  This is wrapped by the __REDIRECT
   macro, in order to support compilers that can do this some other
   way.  When compilers don't support asm-names at all, we have to do
   preprocessor tricks instead (which don't have exactly the right
   semantics, but it's the best we can do).

   Example:
   int __REDIRECT(setpgrp, (__pid_t pid, __pid_t pgrp), setpgid); *//* Some other non-C99 compiler.  Approximate with [1].  *//* Pre-2.97 GCC did not support C99 flexible arrays but did have
   an equivalent extension with slightly different notation.  *//* GCC 2.97 supports C99 flexible array members as an extension,
   even when in C89 mode or compiling C++ (any version).  *//* Support for flexible arrays.
   Headers that should use flexible arrays only if they're "real"
   (e.g. only if they won't affect sizeof()) should test
   #if __glibc_c99_flexarr_available.  *//* Fortify support.  *//* C++ needs to know that types and declarations are C, not C++.  *//* This is not a typedef so `const __ptr_t' does the right thing.  *//* For these things, GCC behaves the ANSI way normally,
   and the non-ANSI way under -traditional.  *//* These two macros are not used in glibc anymore.  They are kept here
   only because some other projects expect the macros to be defined.  *//* Compilers that are not clang may object to
       #if defined __clang__ && __has_extension(...)
   even though they do not need to evaluate the right-hand side of the &&.  *//* GCC.  *//* No inline functions.  *//* Not GCC.  *//* GCC can always grok prototypes.  For C++ programs we add throw()
   to help it optimize the function calls.  But this works only with
   gcc 2.8.x and egcs.  For gcc 3.2 and up we even mark C functions
   as non-throwing using a function attribute since programs can use
   the -fexceptions options for C code as well.  *//* All functions, except those with callbacks or those that
   synchronize memory, are leaf functions.  *//* Some user header file might have defined this before.  *//* The GNU libc does not support any K&R compilers or the traditional mode
   of ISO C compilers anymore.  Check for some of the combinations not
   anymore supported.  *//* We are almost always included from features.h. *//* Copyright (C) 1992-2020 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

   defines %a as a standalone format specifier that reads a floating-
   point number; moreover, POSIX.1-2008 provides the same feature
   using the modifier letter 'm' instead (%ms, %mS, %m[...]).

   We now follow C99 unless GNU extensions are active and the compiler
   is specifically in C89 or C++98 mode (strict or not).  For
   instance, with GCC, -std=gnu11 will have C99-compliant scanf with
   or without -D_GNU_SOURCE, but -std=c89 -D_GNU_SOURCE will have the
   old extension.  *//* The function 'gets' existed in C89, but is impossible to use

   compatibility with various implementations of <cstdio>, this test
   must consider only the value of __cplusplus when compiling C++.  *//* Some C libraries once required _REENTRANT and/or _THREAD_SAFE to be
   defined in all multithreaded code.  GNU libc has not required this
   for many years.  We now treat them as compatibility synonyms for
   _POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L, which is the earliest level of POSIX with
   comprehensive support for multithreaded code.  Using them never
   lowers the selected level of POSIX conformance, only raises it.  *//* If none of the ANSI/POSIX macros are defined, or if _DEFAULT_SOURCE
   is defined, use POSIX.1-2008 (or another version depending on
   _XOPEN_SOURCE).  *//* This is to enable compatibility for ISO C++11.
   Check the temporary macro for now, too.  *//* This is to enable compatibility for ISO C++17.  *//* This is to enable the ISO C90 Amendment 1:1995 extension.  *//* This is to enable the ISO C99 extension.  *//* This is to enable the ISO C11 extension.  *//* This is to enable the ISO C2X extension.  *//* If nothing (other than _GNU_SOURCE and _DEFAULT_SOURCE) is defined,

   or may not also be available in clang, and clang's definitions of

   _FORTIFY_SOURCE	Add security hardening to many library functions.
			Set to 1 or 2; 2 performs stricter checks than 1.

   _REENTRANT, _THREAD_SAFE
			Obsolete; equivalent to _POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L.

   The `-ansi' switch to the GNU C compiler, and standards conformance
   options such as `-std=c99', define __STRICT_ANSI__.  If none of
   these are defined, or if _DEFAULT_SOURCE is defined, the default is
   to have _POSIX_SOURCE set to one and _POSIX_C_SOURCE set to
   200809L, as well as enabling miscellaneous functions from BSD and
   SVID.  If more than one of these are defined, they accumulate.  For
   example __STRICT_ANSI__, _POSIX_SOURCE and _POSIX_C_SOURCE together
   give you ISO C, 1003.1, and 1003.2, but nothing else.

   These are defined by this file and are used by the
   header files to decide what to declare or define:

   __GLIBC_USE (F)	Define things from feature set F.  This is defined
			to 1 or 0; the subsequent macros are either defined
			or undefined, and those tests should be moved to
			__GLIBC_USE.
   __USE_ISOC11		Define ISO C11 things.
   __USE_ISOC99		Define ISO C99 things.
   __USE_ISOC95		Define ISO C90 AMD1 (C95) things.
   __USE_ISOCXX11	Define ISO C++11 things.
   __USE_POSIX		Define IEEE Std 1003.1 things.
   __USE_POSIX2		Define IEEE Std 1003.2 things.
   __USE_POSIX199309	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, and .1b things.
   __USE_POSIX199506	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, .1b, .1c and .1i things.
   __USE_XOPEN		Define XPG things.
   __USE_XOPEN_EXTENDED	Define X/Open Unix things.
   __USE_UNIX98		Define Single Unix V2 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K        Define XPG6 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2KXSI     Define XPG6 XSI things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8       Define XPG7 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8XSI    Define XPG7 XSI things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE	Define correct standard I/O things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE64	Define LFS things with separate names.
   __USE_FILE_OFFSET64	Define 64bit interface as default.
   __USE_MISC		Define things from 4.3BSD or System V Unix.
   __USE_ATFILE		Define *at interfaces and AT_* constants for them.
   __USE_GNU		Define GNU extensions.
   __USE_FORTIFY_LEVEL	Additional security measures used, according to level.

   The macros `__GNU_LIBRARY__', `__GLIBC__', and `__GLIBC_MINOR__' are
   defined by this file unconditionally.  `__GNU_LIBRARY__' is provided
   only for compatibility.  All new code should use the other symbols
   to test for features.

   All macros listed above as possibly being defined by this file are
   explicitly undefined if they are not explicitly defined.
   Feature-test macros that are not defined by the user or compiler
   but are implied by the other feature-test macros defined (or by the
   lack of any definitions) are defined by the file.

   ISO C feature test macros depend on the definition of the macro
   when an affected header is included, not when the first system
   header is included, and so they are handled in
   <bits/libc-header-start.h>, which does not have a multiple include
   guard.  Feature test macros that can be handled from the first
   system header included are handled here.  *//usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/bits/libc-header-start.h<features.h>__GLIBC_USE_IEC_60559_TYPES_EXT__GLIBC_USE_IEC_60559_FUNCS_EXT_C2X__GLIBC_USE_IEC_60559_FUNCS_EXT__GLIBC_USE_IEC_60559_BFP_EXT_C2X__GLIBC_USE_IEC_60559_BFP_EXT__GLIBC_USE_LIB_EXT2__GLIBC_INTERNAL_STARTING_HEADER_IMPLEMENTATIONdefined __USE_GNU || defined __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_BFP_EXT____GLIBC_USE (IEC_60559_BFP_EXT) || __GLIBC_USE (ISOC2X)defined __USE_GNU || defined __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_FUNCS_EXT____GLIBC_USE (IEC_60559_FUNCS_EXT) || __GLIBC_USE (ISOC2X)defined __USE_GNU || defined __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_TYPES_EXT__ISOC2XIEC_60559_FUNCS_EXTIEC_60559_BFP_EXT/* ISO/IEC TS 18661-3:2015 defines the

   included.  *//* Handle feature test macros at the start of a header.

   macros for each of the OS types we define below.  The definitions
   of those macros must use the following macros for underlying types.
   We define __S<SIZE>_TYPE and __U<SIZE>_TYPE for the signed and unsigned
   variants of each of the following integer types on this machine.

	16		-- "natural" 16-bit type (always short)
	32		-- "natural" 32-bit type (always int)
	64		-- "natural" 64-bit type (long or long long)
	LONG32		-- 32-bit type, traditionally long
	QUAD		-- 64-bit type, traditionally long long
	WORD		-- natural type of __WORDSIZE bits (int or long)
	LONGWORD	-- type of __WORDSIZE bits, traditionally long

   We distinguish WORD/LONGWORD, 32/LONG32, and 64/QUAD so that the
   conventional uses of `long' or `long long' type modifiers match the
   types we define, even when a less-adorned type would be the same size.
   This matters for (somewhat) portably writing printf/scanf formats for
   these types, where using the appropriate l or ll format modifiers can
   make the typedefs and the formats match up across all GNU platforms.  If
   we used `long' when it's 64 bits where `long long' is expected, then the
   compiler would warn about the formats not matching the argument types,
   and the programmer changing them to shut up the compiler would break the
   program's portability.

   Here we assume what is presently the case in all the GCC configurations
   we support: long long is always 64 bits, long is always word/address size,
   and int is always 32 bits.  *//* Largest integral types.  *//* quad_t is also 64 bits.  *//* Smallest types with at least a given width.  *//* Fixed-size types, underlying types depend on word size and compiler.  *//* Convenience types.  *//*
 * Never include this file directly; use <sys/types.h> instead.
 *//* bits/types.h -- definitions of __*_t types underlying *_t types.

   rune_t in some cases... *//* Why is this file so hard to maintain properly?  In contrast to
   the comment above regarding BSD/386 1.1, on FreeBSD for as long
   as the symbol has existed, _BSD_RUNE_T_ must not stay defined or
   redundant typedefs will occur when stdlib.h is included after this file. *//* Darwin *//* On BSD/386 1.1, at least, machine/ansi.h defines _BSD_WCHAR_T_
   instead of _WCHAR_T_, and _BSD_RUNE_T_ (which, unlike the other
   symbols in the _FOO_T_ family, stays defined even after its
   corresponding type is defined).  If we define wchar_t, then we
   must undef _WCHAR_T_; for BSD/386 1.1 (and perhaps others), if
   we undef _WCHAR_T_, then we must also define rune_t, since 
   headers like runetype.h assume that if machine/ansi.h is included,
   and _BSD_WCHAR_T_ is not defined, then rune_t is available.

   the same type." *//* Cray Unicos/Mk *//* BeOS *//* FreeBSD 5 *//* Define this type if we are doing the whole job,
   or if we want this type in particular.  *//* Wide character type.

   GCC 2.00, make sure that __PTRDIFF_TYPE__, __SIZE_TYPE__, and
   __WCHAR_TYPE__ have reasonable values.  This can happen if the
   parts of GCC is compiled by an older compiler, that actually
   include gstddef.h, such as collect2.  *//* On VxWorks, <type/vxTypesBase.h> may have defined macros like
   _TYPE_size_t which will typedef size_t.  fixincludes patched the
   vxTypesBase.h so that this macro is only defined if _GCC_SIZE_T is
   not defined, and so that defining this macro defines _GCC_SIZE_T.
   If we find that the macros are still defined at this point, we must
   invoke them so that the type is defined as expected.  *//* Sequent's header files use _PTRDIFF_T_ in some conflicting way.
   Just ignore it.  *//* defined(__NetBSD__) *//* Undef _FOO_T_ if we are supposed to define foo_t.  *//* On BSD/386 1.1, at least, machine/ansi.h defines _BSD_WCHAR_T_

   There's no way to win with the other order!  Sun lossage.  *//* snaroff@next.com says the NeXT needs this.  *//* Any one of these symbols __need_* means that GNU libc
   wants us just to define one data type.  So don't define
   the symbols that indicate this file's entire job has been done.  *//*

   arguments in ARGV (ARGC of them, minus the program name) for
   options given in OPTS.

   Return the option character from OPTS just read.  Return -1 when
   there are no more options.  For unrecognized options, or options
   missing arguments, 'optopt' is set to the option letter, and '?' is
   returned.

   The OPTS string is a list of characters which are recognized option
   letters, optionally followed by colons, specifying that that letter
   takes an argument, to be placed in 'optarg'.

   If a letter in OPTS is followed by two colons, its argument is
   optional.  This behavior is specific to the GNU 'getopt'.

   The argument '--' causes premature termination of argument
   scanning, explicitly telling 'getopt' that there are no more
   options.

   If OPTS begins with '-', then non-option arguments are treated as
   arguments to the option '\1'.  This behavior is specific to the GNU
   'getopt'.  If OPTS begins with '+', or POSIXLY_CORRECT is set in
   the environment, then do not permute arguments.

   For standards compliance, the 'argv' argument has the type
   char *const *, but this is inaccurate; if argument permutation is
   enabled, the argv array (not the strings it points to) must be
   writable.  *//* Set to an option character which was unrecognized.  *//* Callers store zero here to inhibit the error message 'getopt' prints
   for unrecognized options.  *//* Index in ARGV of the next element to be scanned.
   This is used for communication to and from the caller
   and for communication between successive calls to 'getopt'.

   On entry to 'getopt', zero means this is the first call; initialize.

   When 'getopt' returns -1, this is the index of the first of the
   non-option elements that the caller should itself scan.

   Otherwise, 'optind' communicates from one call to the next
   how much of ARGV has been scanned so far.  *//* For communication from 'getopt' to the caller.
   When 'getopt' finds an option that takes an argument,
   the argument value is returned here.
   Also, when 'ordering' is RETURN_IN_ORDER,
   each non-option ARGV-element is returned here.  *//* This header should not be used directly; include getopt.h or
   unistd.h instead.  Unlike most bits headers, it does not have
   a protective #error, because the guard macro for getopt.h in
   gnulib is not fixed.  *//* Declarations for getopt (basic, portable features only).

   is without partner.  *//* One-way hash PHRASE, returning a string suitable for storage in the

   The CMD argument is one of the following.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* NOTE: These declarations also appear in <fcntl.h>; be sure to keep both
   files consistent.  Some systems have them there and some here, and some
   software depends on the macros being defined without including both.  *//* Invoke `system call' number SYSNO, passing it the remaining arguments.
   This is completely system-dependent, and not often useful.

   In Unix, `syscall' sets `errno' for all errors and most calls return -1
   for errors; in many systems you cannot pass arguments or get return
   values for all system calls (`pipe', `fork', and `getppid' typically
   among them).

   In Mach, all system calls take normal arguments and always return an
   error code (zero for success).  *//* Increase or decrease the end of accessible data space by DELTA bytes.
   If successful, returns the address the previous end of data space
   (i.e. the beginning of the new space, if DELTA > 0);
   returns (void *) -1 for errors (with errno set).  *//* Set the end of accessible data space (aka "the break") to ADDR.
   Returns zero on success and -1 for errors (with errno set).  *//* Use POSIX.1b || X/Open Unix || XPG6.  *//* Truncate the file FD is open on to LENGTH bytes.  *//* Use X/Open Unix || POSIX 2008.  *//* Truncate FILE to LENGTH bytes.  *//* Use misc || X/Open Unix.  *//* Return the maximum number of file descriptors
   the current process could possibly have.  *//* Return the number of bytes in a page.  This is the system's page size,
   which is not necessarily the same as the hardware page size.  *//* Make all changes done to all files actually appear on disk.  *//* Return identifier for the current host.  *//* Make all changes done to all files on the file system associated
   with FD actually appear on disk.  *//* Make all changes done to FD actually appear on disk.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Use misc || X/Open.  *//* Prompt with PROMPT and read a string from the terminal without echoing.
   Uses /dev/tty if possible; otherwise stderr and stdin.  *//* Make PATH be the root directory (the starting point for absolute paths).
   This call is restricted to the super-user.  *//* Put the program in the background, and dissociate from the controlling
   terminal.  If NOCHDIR is zero, do `chdir ("/")'.  If NOCLOSE is zero,
   redirects stdin, stdout, and stderr to /dev/null.  *//* Rewind and re-read the file.  *//* Discard cached info.  *//* Successive calls return the shells listed in `/etc/shells'.  *//* Turn accounting on if NAME is an existing file.  The system will then write
   a record for each process as it terminates, to this file.  If NAME is NULL,
   turn accounting off.  This call is restricted to the super-user.  *//* Enable statistical profiling, writing samples of the PC into at most
   SIZE bytes of SAMPLE_BUFFER; every processor clock tick while profiling
   is enabled, the system examines the user PC and increments
   SAMPLE_BUFFER[((PC - OFFSET) / 2) * SCALE / 65536].  If SCALE is zero,
   disable profiling.  Returns zero on success, -1 on error.  *//* Revoke the access of all descriptors currently open on FILE.  *//* Revoke access permissions to all processes currently communicating
   with the control terminal, and then send a SIGHUP signal to the process
   group of the control terminal.  *//* Get and set the NIS (aka YP) domain name, if any.
   Called just like `gethostname' and `sethostname'.
   The NIS domain name is usually the empty string when not using NIS.  *//* Set the current machine's Internet number to ID.
   This call is restricted to the super-user.  *//* Set the name of the current host to NAME, which is LEN bytes long.
   This call is restricted to the super-user.  *//* Put the name of the current host in no more than LEN bytes of NAME.
   The result is null-terminated if LEN is large enough for the full
   name and the terminator.  *//* Get definitions and prototypes for functions to process the
   arguments in ARGV (ARGC of them, minus the program name) for
   options given in OPTS.  *//* Set the login name returned by `getlogin'.  *//* Return at most NAME_LEN characters of the login name of the user in NAME.
   If it cannot be determined or some other error occurred, return the error
   code.  Otherwise return 0.

   This function is a possible cancellation point and therefore not
   marked with __THROW.  *//* Return the login name of the user.

   This function is a possible cancellation point and therefore not
   marked with __THROW.  *//* Set the foreground process group ID of FD set PGRP_ID.  *//* Return the foreground process group ID of FD.  *//* Remove the directory PATH.  *//* Remove the link NAME relative to FD.  *//* Remove the link NAME.  *//* Like readlink but a relative PATH is interpreted relative to FD.  *//* Like symlink but a relative path in TO is interpreted relative to TOFD.  *//* Use POSIX.1-2001.  *//* Read the contents of the symbolic link PATH into no more than
   LEN bytes of BUF.  The contents are not null-terminated.
   Returns the number of characters read, or -1 for errors.  *//* Make a symbolic link to FROM named TO.  *//* Like link but relative paths in TO and FROM are interpreted relative
   to FROMFD and TOFD respectively.  *//* Make a link to FROM named TO.  *//* Return the index into the active-logins file (utmp) for
   the controlling terminal.  *//* Return 1 if FD is a valid descriptor associated
   with a terminal, zero if not.  *//* Store at most BUFLEN characters of the pathname of the terminal FD is
   open on in BUF.  Return 0 on success, otherwise an error number.  *//* Return the pathname of the terminal FD is open on, or NULL on errors.
   The returned storage is good only until the next call to this function.  *//* Use misc or XPG < 7. *//* Clone the calling process, but without copying the whole address space.
   The calling process is suspended until the new process exits or is
   replaced by a call to `execve'.  Return -1 for errors, 0 to the new process,
   and the process ID of the new process to the old process.  *//* Clone the calling process, creating an exact copy.
   Return -1 for errors, 0 to the new process,
   and the process ID of the new process to the old process.  *//* Set the real group ID, effective group ID, and saved-set group ID,
   of the calling process to RGID, EGID, and SGID, respectively.  *//* Set the real user ID, effective user ID, and saved-set user ID,

   and the effective user ID of the calling process to EUID.  *//* Set the user ID of the calling process to UID.
   If the calling process is the super-user, set the real
   and effective user IDs, and the saved set-user-ID to UID;
   if not, the effective user ID is set to UID.  *//* Return nonzero iff the calling process is in group GID.  *//* If SIZE is zero, return the number of supplementary groups
   the calling process is in.  Otherwise, fill in the group IDs
   of its supplementary groups in LIST and return the number written.  *//* Get the effective group ID of the calling process.  *//* Get the real group ID of the calling process.  *//* Get the effective user ID of the calling process.  *//* Get the real user ID of the calling process.  *//* Return the session ID of the given process.  *//* Create a new session with the calling process as its leader.
   The process group IDs of the session and the calling process
   are set to the process ID of the calling process, which is returned.  *//* Use misc or X/Open.  *//* Set the process group ID of the calling process to its own PID.
   This is exactly the same as `setpgid (0, 0)'.  *//* Both System V and BSD have `setpgrp' functions, but with different
   calling conventions.  The BSD function is the same as POSIX.1 `setpgid'
   (above).  The System V function takes no arguments and puts the calling
   process in its on group like `setpgid (0, 0)'.

   New programs should always use `setpgid' instead.

   GNU provides the POSIX.1 function.  *//* Set the process group ID of the process matching PID to PGID.
   If PID is zero, the current process's process group ID is set.
   If PGID is zero, the process ID of the process is used.  *//* Get the process group ID of process PID.  *//* Get the process group ID of the calling process.  *//* Get the process ID of the calling process's parent.  *//* Get the process ID of the calling process.  *//* Get the value of the string-valued system variable NAME.  *//* Get the value of the system variable NAME.  *//* Get file-specific configuration about descriptor FD.  *//* Get file-specific configuration information about PATH.  *//* Get the `_PC_*' symbols for the NAME argument to `pathconf' and `fpathconf';
   the `_SC_*' symbols for the NAME argument to `sysconf';
   and the `_CS_*' symbols for the NAME argument to `confstr'.  *//* Terminate program execution with the low-order 8 bits of STATUS.  *//* Add INC to priority of the current process.  *//* Execute FILE, searching in the `PATH' environment variable if it contains
   no slashes, with arguments ARGV and environment from `environ'.  *//* Execute FILE, searching in the `PATH' environment variable if
   it contains no slashes, with all arguments after FILE until a
   NULL pointer and environment from `environ'.  *//* Execute PATH with all arguments after PATH until
   a NULL pointer and environment from `environ'.  *//* Execute PATH with all arguments after PATH until a NULL pointer,
   and the argument after that for environment.  *//* Execute PATH with arguments ARGV and environment from `environ'.  *//* Execute the file FD refers to, overlaying the running program image.
   ARGV and ENVP are passed to the new program, as for `execve'.  *//* Replace the current process, executing PATH with arguments ARGV and
   environment ENVP.  ARGV and ENVP are terminated by NULL pointers.  *//* NULL-terminated array of "NAME=VALUE" environment variables.  *//* Duplicate FD to FD2, closing FD2 and making it open on the same
   file while setting flags according to FLAGS.  *//* Duplicate FD to FD2, closing FD2 and making it open on the same file.  *//* Duplicate FD, returning a new file descriptor on the same file.  *//* Put the absolute pathname of the current working directory in BUF.
   If successful, return BUF.  If not, put an error message in
   BUF and return NULL.  BUF should be at least PATH_MAX bytes long.  *//* Return a malloc'd string containing the current directory name.
   If the environment variable `PWD' is set, and its value is correct,
   that value is used.  *//* Get the pathname of the current working directory,
   and put it in SIZE bytes of BUF.  Returns NULL if the
   directory couldn't be determined or SIZE was too small.
   If successful, returns BUF.  In GNU, if BUF is NULL,
   an array is allocated with `malloc'; the array is SIZE
   bytes long, unless SIZE == 0, in which case it is as
   big as necessary.  *//* Change the process's working directory to the one FD is open on.  *//* Change the process's working directory to PATH.  *//* Use GNU.  *//* Change the owner and group of FILE relative to the directory FD is open
   on.  *//* Use X/Open Unix.  *//* Change owner and group of FILE, if it is a symbolic
   link the ownership of the symbolic link is changed.  *//* Change the owner and group of the file that FD is open on.  *//* Change the owner and group of FILE.  *//* Suspend the process until a signal arrives.
   This always returns -1 and sets `errno' to EINTR.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Sleep USECONDS microseconds, or until a signal arrives that is not blocked
   or ignored.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Set an alarm to go off (generating a SIGALRM signal) in VALUE
   microseconds.  If INTERVAL is nonzero, when the alarm goes off, the
   timer is reset to go off every INTERVAL microseconds thereafter.
   Returns the number of microseconds remaining before the alarm.  *//* Make the process sleep for SECONDS seconds, or until a signal arrives
   and is not ignored.  The function returns the number of seconds less
   than SECONDS which it actually slept (thus zero if it slept the full time).
   If a signal handler does a `longjmp' or modifies the handling of the
   SIGALRM signal while inside `sleep' call, the handling of the SIGALRM
   signal afterwards is undefined.  There is no return value to indicate
   error, but if `sleep' returns SECONDS, it probably didn't work.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Schedule an alarm.  In SECONDS seconds, the process will get a SIGALRM.
   If SECONDS is zero, any currently scheduled alarm will be cancelled.
   The function returns the number of seconds remaining until the last
   alarm scheduled would have signaled, or zero if there wasn't one.
   There is no return value to indicate an error, but you can set `errno'
   to 0 and check its value after calling `alarm', and this might tell you.
   The signal may come late due to processor scheduling.  *//* Same as pipe but apply flags passed in FLAGS to the new file
   descriptors.  *//* Create a one-way communication channel (pipe).
   If successful, two file descriptors are stored in PIPEDES;
   bytes written on PIPEDES[1] can be read from PIPEDES[0].
   Returns 0 if successful, -1 if not.  *//* Write N bytes of BUF to FD at the given position OFFSET without
   changing the file pointer.  Return the number written, or -1.  *//* Read NBYTES into BUF from FD at the given position OFFSET without
   changing the file pointer.  Return the number read, -1 for errors
   or 0 for EOF.  *//* Write N bytes of BUF to FD at the given position OFFSET without
   changing the file pointer.  Return the number written, or -1.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with

   beginning of the file (if WHENCE is SEEK_SET),
   the current position (if WHENCE is SEEK_CUR),
   or the end of the file (if WHENCE is SEEK_END).
   Return the new file position.  *//* Old BSD names for the same constants; just for compatibility.  *//* Seek to next hole.  *//* Seek to next data.  *//* Seek from end of file.  *//* Seek from current position.  *//* Seek from beginning of file.  *//* <stdio.h> has the same definitions.  *//* Values for the WHENCE argument to lseek.  *//* Test for access to FILE relative to the directory FD is open on.
   If AT_EACCESS is set in FLAG, then use effective IDs like `eaccess',

   This file provides prototype declarations for the math functions.
   Most functions are declared using the macro:

   __MATHCALL (NAME,[_r], (ARGS...));

   This means there is a function `NAME' returning `double' and a function
   `NAMEf' returning `float'.  Each place `_Mdouble_' appears in the
   prototype, that is actually `double' in the prototype for `NAME' and
   `float' in the prototype for `NAMEf'.  Reentrant variant functions are
   called `NAME_r' and `NAMEf_r'.

   Functions returning other types like `int' are declared using the macro:

   __MATHDECL (TYPE, NAME,[_r], (ARGS...));

   This is just like __MATHCALL but for a function returning `TYPE'
   instead of `_Mdouble_'.  In all of these cases, there is still
   both a `NAME' and a `NAMEf' that takes `float' arguments.

   Note that there must be no whitespace before the argument passed for
   NAME, to make token pasting work with -traditional.  *//* Prototype declarations for math functions; helper file for <math.h>.

     in C++.  *//* In C++ mode, __MATH_TG cannot be used, because it relies on
   __builtin_types_compatible_p, which is a C-only builtin.  Moreover,
   the comparison macros from ISO C take two floating-point arguments,
   which need not have the same type.  Choosing what underlying function
   to call requires evaluating the formats of the arguments, then
   selecting which is wider.  The macro __MATH_EVAL_FMT2 provides this
   information, however, only the type of the macro expansion is
   relevant (actually evaluating the expression would be incorrect).
   Thus, the type is used as a template parameter for __iseqsig_type,
   which calls the appropriate underlying function.  *//* Return X == Y but raising "invalid" and setting errno if X or Y is
   a NaN.  *//* An expression whose type has the widest of the evaluation formats
   of X and Y (which are of floating-point types).  *//* Get machine-dependent inline versions (if there are any).  *//* isunordered must always check both operands first for signaling NaNs.  *//* ISO C99 defines some macros to compare number while taking care for
   unordered numbers.  Many FPUs provide special instructions to support
   these operations.  Generic support in GCC for these as builtins went
   in 2.97, but not all cpus added their patterns until 3.1.  Therefore
   we enable the builtins from 3.1 onwards and use a generic implementation
   othwerwise.  *//* When compiling in strict ISO C compatible mode we must not use the
   inline functions since they, among other things, do not set the
   `errno' variable correctly.  *//* 1/sqrt(2) *//* sqrt(2) *//* 2/sqrt(pi) *//* 2/pi *//* 1/pi *//* pi/4 *//* pi/2 *//* pi *//* log_e 10 *//* log_e 2 *//* log_10 e *//* log_2 e *//* e *//* The above constants are not adequate for computation using `long double's.
   Therefore we provide as an extension constants with similar names as a
   GNU extension.  Provide enough digits for the 128-bit IEEE quad.  *//* Some useful constants.  *//* X/Open wants another strange constant.  *//* Use IEC_60559_BFP_EXT.  *//* extern C++ *//* Return nonzero value if X is zero.  *//* Return nonzero value if X is subnormal.  *//* When using an IEEE 128-bit long double, _Float128 is defined as long double
   in C++.  *//* In C++ mode, __MATH_TG cannot be used, because it relies on
      __builtin_types_compatible_p, which is a C-only builtin.  On the
      other hand, overloading provides the means to distinguish between
      the floating-point types.  The overloading resolution will match
      the correct parameter (regardless of type qualifiers (i.e.: const
      and volatile)).  *//* Return nonzero value if X is a signaling NaN.  *//* By default all math functions support both errno and exception handling
   (except for soft floating point implementations which may only support
   errno handling).  If errno handling is disabled, exceptions are still
   supported by GLIBC.  Set math_errhandling to 0 with -ffast-math (this is
   nonconforming but it is more useful than leaving it undefined).  *//* Exceptions raised by math functions.  *//* errno set by math functions.  *//* Bitmasks for the math_errhandling macro.  *//* Since __builtin_isinf_sign is broken for float128 before GCC 7.0,
      use the helper function, __isinff128, with older compilers.  This is
      only provided for C mode, because in C++ mode, GCC has no support
      for __builtin_types_compatible_p (and when in C++ mode, this macro is
      not used anyway, because libstdc++ headers undefine it).  *//* Return nonzero value if X is positive or negative infinity.  *//* Return nonzero value if X is a NaN.  We could use `fpclassify' but
   we already have this functions `__isnan' and it is faster.  *//* Return nonzero value if X is neither zero, subnormal, Inf, nor NaN.  *//* Return nonzero value if X is not +-Inf or NaN.  *//* In C++ mode, __MATH_TG cannot be used, because it relies on
     __builtin_types_compatible_p, which is a C-only builtin.
     The check for __cplusplus allows the use of the builtin instead of
     __MATH_TG. This is provided for libstdc++, only to let its configure
     test work. No further use of this definition of signbit is expected
     in C++ mode, since libstdc++ provides its own version of signbit
     in cmath (which undefines signbit). *//* Return nonzero value if sign of X is negative.  *//* The check for __cplusplus allows the use of the builtin, even
	when optimization for size is on.  This is provided for
	libstdc++, only to let its configure test work when it is built
	with -Os.  No further use of this definition of fpclassify is
	expected in C++ mode, since libstdc++ provides its own version
	of fpclassify in cmath (which undefines fpclassify).  *//* Return number of classification appropriate for X.  *//* GCC bug 66462 means we cannot use the math builtins with -fsignaling-nan,
   so disable builtins if this is enabled.  When fixed in a newer GCC,
   the __SUPPORT_SNAN__ check may be skipped for those versions.  *//* All floating-point numbers can be put in one of these categories.  *//* ISO C99 defines some generic macros which work on any data type.  *//* Depending on the type of TG_ARG, call an appropriately suffixed
   version of FUNC with arguments (including parentheses) ARGS.
   Suffixed functions may not exist for long double if it has the same
   format as double, or for other types with the same format as float,
   double or long double.  The behavior is undefined if the argument
   does not have a real floating type.  The definition may use a
   conditional expression, so all suffixed versions of FUNC must
   return the same type (FUNC may include a cast if necessary rather
   than being a single identifier).  *//* This variable is used by `gamma' and `lgamma'.  *//* Declare functions returning a narrower type.  *//* __HAVE_DISTINCT_FLOAT128X || (__HAVE_FLOAT128X && !_LIBC).  *//* __HAVE_DISTINCT_FLOAT64X || (__HAVE_FLOAT64X && !_LIBC).  *//* __HAVE_DISTINCT_FLOAT32X || (__HAVE_FLOAT32X && !_LIBC).  *//* __HAVE_DISTINCT_FLOAT128 || (__HAVE_FLOAT128 && !_LIBC).  *//* __HAVE_DISTINCT_FLOAT64 || (__HAVE_FLOAT64 && !_LIBC).  *//* __HAVE_DISTINCT_FLOAT32 || (__HAVE_FLOAT32 && !_LIBC).  *//* __HAVE_DISTINCT_FLOAT16 || (__HAVE_FLOAT16 && !_LIBC).  *//* Include the file of declarations for _FloatN and _FloatNx

   *  Binders turn functions/functors with two arguments into functors
   *  with a single argument, storing an argument to be applied later.
   *  For example, a variable @c B of type @c binder1st is constructed
   *  from a functor @c f and an argument @c x. Later, B's @c
   *  operator() is called with a single argument @c y. The return
   *  value is the value of @c f(x,y). @c B can be @a called with
   *  various arguments (y1, y2, ...) and will in turn call @c
   *  f(x,y1), @c f(x,y2), ...
   *
   *  The function @c bind1st is provided to save some typing. It takes the
   *  function and an argument as parameters, and returns an instance of
   *  @c binder1st.
   *
   *  The type @c binder2nd and its creator function @c bind2nd do the same
   *  thing, but the stored argument is passed as the second parameter instead
   *  of the first, e.g., @c bind2nd(std::minus<float>(),1.3) will create a
   *  functor whose @c operator() accepts a floating-point number, subtracts
   *  1.3 from it, and returns the result. (If @c bind1st had been used,
   *  the functor would perform <em>1.3 - x</em> instead.
   *
   *  Creator-wrapper functions like @c bind1st are intended to be used in
   *  calling algorithms. Their return values will be temporary objects.
   *  (The goal is to not require you to type names like
   *  @c std::binder1st<std::plus<int>> for declaring a variable to hold the
   *  return value from @c bind1st(std::plus<int>(),5).
   *
   *  These become more useful when combined with the composition functions.
   *
   *  These functions are deprecated in C++11 and can be replaced by
   *  @c std::bind (or @c std::tr1::bind) which is more powerful and flexible,
   *  supporting functions with any number of arguments.  Uses of @c bind1st
   *  can be replaced by @c std::bind(f, x, std::placeholders::_1) and
   *  @c bind2nd by @c std::bind(f, std::placeholders::_1, x).

   *
   *  The advantage of function objects over pointers to functions is that
   *  the objects in the standard library declare nested typedefs describing
   *  their argument and result types with uniform names (e.g., @c result_type
   *  from the base classes @c unary_function and @c binary_function).
   *  Sometimes those typedefs are required, not just optional.
   *
   *  Adaptors are provided to turn pointers to unary (single-argument) and
   *  binary (double-argument) functions into function objects.  The
   *  long-winded functor @c pointer_to_unary_function is constructed with a
   *  function pointer @c f, and its @c operator() called with argument @c x
   *  returns @c f(x).  The functor @c pointer_to_binary_function does the same
   *  thing, but with a double-argument @c f and @c operator().
   *
   *  The function @c ptr_fun takes a pointer-to-function @c f and constructs
   *  an instance of the appropriate functor.

   *  The functions @c not1 and @c not2 each take a predicate functor
   *  and return an instance of @c unary_negate or
   *  @c binary_negate, respectively.  These classes are functors whose
   *  @c operator() performs the stored predicate function and then returns
   *  the negation of the result.
   *
   *  For example, given a vector of integers and a trivial predicate,
   *  \code
   *  struct IntGreaterThanThree
   *    : public std::unary_function<int, bool>
   *  {
   *      bool operator() (int x) { return x > 3; }

   *
   *  std::find_if (v.begin(), v.end(), not1(IntGreaterThanThree()));
   *  \endcode
   *  The call to @c find_if will locate the first index (i) of @c v for which
   *  <code>!(v[i] > 3)</code> is true.
   *
   *  The not1/unary_negate combination works on predicates taking a single
   *  argument.  The not2/binary_negate combination works on predicates which

   *
   *  Function objects, or @e functors, are objects with an @c operator()
   *  defined and accessible.  They can be passed as arguments to algorithm
   *  templates and used in place of a function pointer.  Not only is the
   *  resulting expressiveness of the library increased, but the generated
   *  code can be more efficient than what you might write by hand.  When we
   *  refer to @a functors, then, generally we include function pointers in
   *  the description as well.
   *
   *  Often, functors are only created as temporaries passed to algorithm
   *  calls, rather than being created as named variables.
   *
   *  Two examples taken from the standard itself follow.  To perform a
   *  by-element addition of two vectors @c a and @c b containing @c double,
   *  and put the result in @c a, use
   *  \code
   *  transform (a.begin(), a.end(), b.begin(), a.begin(), plus<double>());
   *  \endcode
   *  To negate every element in @c a, use
   *  \code
   *  transform(a.begin(), a.end(), a.begin(), negate<double>());
   *  \endcode
   *  The addition and negation functions will be inlined directly.
   *
   *  The standard functors are derived from structs named @c unary_function
   *  and @c binary_function.  These two classes contain nothing but typedefs,
   *  to aid in generic (template) programming.  If you write your own
   *  functors, you might consider doing the same.

   *  Nearly all of the I/O classes are parameterized on the type of
   *  characters they read and write.  (The major exception is ios_base at
   *  the top of the hierarchy.)  This is a change from pre-Standard
   *  streams, which were not templates.
   *
   *  For ease of use and compatibility, all of the basic_* I/O-related
   *  classes are given typedef names for both of the builtin character
   *  widths (wide and narrow).  The typedefs are the same as the
   *  pre-Standard names, for example:
   *
   *  @code
   *     typedef basic_ifstream<char>  ifstream;
   *  @endcode
   *
   *  Because properly forward-declaring these classes can be difficult, you
   *  should not do it yourself.  Instead, include the &lt;iosfwd&gt;
   *  header, which contains only declarations of all the I/O classes as
   *  well as the typedefs.  Trying to forward-declare the typedefs
   *  themselves (e.g., <code>class ostream;</code>) is not valid ISO C++.

pthread.h *//* Optimizations.  *//* Install handlers to be called when a new process is created with FORK.
   The PREPARE handler is called in the parent process just before performing
   FORK. The PARENT handler is called in the parent process just after FORK.
   The CHILD handler is called in the child process.  Each of the three
   handlers can be NULL, meaning that no handler needs to be called at that
   point.
   PTHREAD_ATFORK can be called several times, in which case the PREPARE
   handlers are called in LIFO order (last added with PTHREAD_ATFORK,
   first called before FORK), and the PARENT and CHILD handlers are called
   in FIFO (first added, first called).  *//* Get ID of CPU-time clock for thread THREAD_ID.  *//* Store POINTER in the thread-specific data slot identified by KEY. *//* Return current value of the thread-specific data slot identified by KEY.  *//* Destroy KEY.  *//* Create a key value identifying a location in the thread-specific
   data area.  Each thread maintains a distinct thread-specific data
   area.  DESTR_FUNCTION, if non-NULL, is called with the value
   associated to that key when the key is destroyed.
   DESTR_FUNCTION is not called if the value associated is NULL when
   the key is destroyed.  *//* Functions for handling thread-specific data.  *//* Set the process-shared flag of the barrier attribute ATTR.  *//* Get the process-shared flag of the barrier attribute ATTR.  *//* Destroy previously dynamically initialized barrier attribute ATTR.  *//* Initialize barrier attribute ATTR.  *//* Wait on barrier BARRIER.  *//* Destroy a previously dynamically initialized barrier BARRIER.  *//* Initialize BARRIER with the attributes in ATTR.

   If EXECUTE is non-zero, the handler function is called. *//* Install a cleanup handler: ROUTINE will be called with arguments ARG
   when the thread is canceled or calls pthread_exit.  ROUTINE will also
   be called with arguments ARG when the matching pthread_cleanup_pop
   is executed with non-zero EXECUTE argument.

   pthread_cleanup_push and pthread_cleanup_pop are macros and must always
   be used in matching pairs at the same nesting level of braces.  *//* Function called to call the cleanup handler.  As an extern inline

   Note that these functions are explicitly not marked to not throw an
   exception in C++ code.  If cancellation is implemented by unwinding
   this is necessary to have the compiler generate the unwind information.  *//* Guarantee that the initialization function INIT_ROUTINE will be called
   only once, even if pthread_once is executed several times with the
   same ONCE_CONTROL argument. ONCE_CONTROL must point to a static or
   extern variable initialized to PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT.

   The initialization functions might throw exception which is why
   this function is not marked with __THROW.  *//* Functions for handling initialization.  *//* Get bit set in CPUSET representing the processors TH can run on.  *//* Limit specified thread TH to run only on the processors represented
   in CPUSET.  *//* Yield the processor to another thread or process.
   This function is similar to the POSIX `sched_yield' function but
   might be differently implemented in the case of a m-on-n thread
   implementation.  *//* Set new concurrency level to LEVEL.  *//* Determine level of concurrency.  *//* Set thread name visible in the kernel and its interfaces.  *//* Get thread name visible in the kernel and its interfaces.  *//* Set the scheduling priority for TARGET_THREAD.  *//* Return in *POLICY and *PARAM the scheduling parameters for TARGET_THREAD. *//* Set the scheduling parameters for TARGET_THREAD according to POLICY
   and *PARAM.  *//* Functions for scheduling control.  *//* Initialize thread attribute *ATTR with attributes corresponding to the

   and destroyed with pthread_attr_destroy when no longer needed.  *//* Set the default attributes to be used by pthread_create in this
   process.  *//* Get the default attributes used by pthread_create in this process.  *//* Get bit set in CPUSET representing the processors threads created with
   ATTR can run on.  *//* Thread created with attribute ATTR will be limited to run only on
   the processors represented in CPUSET.  *//* The following two interfaces are intended to replace the last two.  They
   require setting the address as well as the size since only setting the
   address will make the implementation on some architectures impossible.  *//* Return the previously set address for the stack.  *//* Add information about the minimum stack size needed for the thread
   to be started.  This size must never be less than PTHREAD_STACK_MIN
   and must also not exceed the system limits.  *//* Return the currently used minimal stack size.  *//* Set the starting address of the stack of the thread to be created.
   Depending on whether the stack grows up or down the value must either
   be higher or lower than all the address in the memory block.  The
   minimal size of the block must be PTHREAD_STACK_MIN.  *//* Set scheduling contention scope in *ATTR according to SCOPE.  *//* Return in *SCOPE the scheduling contention scope of *ATTR.  *//* Set scheduling inheritance mode in *ATTR according to INHERIT.  *//* Return in *INHERIT the scheduling inheritance mode of *ATTR.  *//* Set scheduling policy in *ATTR according to POLICY.  *//* Return in *POLICY the scheduling policy of *ATTR.  *//* Set scheduling parameters (priority, etc) in *ATTR according to PARAM.  *//* Return in *PARAM the scheduling parameters of *ATTR.  *//* Set the size of the guard area created for stack overflow protection.  *//* Get the size of the guard area created for stack overflow protection.  *//* Set detach state attribute.  *//* Get detach state attribute.  *//* Destroy thread attribute *ATTR.  *//* Initialize thread attribute *ATTR with default attributes
   (detachstate is PTHREAD_JOINABLE, scheduling policy is SCHED_OTHER,
    no user-provided stack).  *//* Thread attribute handling.  *//* Compare two thread identifiers.  *//* Obtain the identifier of the current thread.  *//* Indicate that the thread TH is never to be joined with PTHREAD_JOIN.
   The resources of TH will therefore be freed immediately when it
   terminates, instead of waiting for another thread to perform PTHREAD_JOIN
   on it.  *//* Make calling thread wait for termination of the thread TH, but only
   until TIMEOUT measured against the clock specified by CLOCKID.  The
   exit status of the thread is stored in *THREAD_RETURN, if
   THREAD_RETURN is not NULL.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Make calling thread wait for termination of the thread TH, but only
   until TIMEOUT.  The exit status of the thread is stored in
   *THREAD_RETURN, if THREAD_RETURN is not NULL.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Check whether thread TH has terminated.  If yes return the status of
   the thread in *THREAD_RETURN, if THREAD_RETURN is not NULL.  *//* Make calling thread wait for termination of the thread TH.  The

   calls in shared flavors of the HP-UX C library.  Most of the stubs
   have no functionality.  The details are described in the "libc cumulative
   patch" for each subversion of HP-UX 11.  There are two special interfaces
   provided for checking whether an application is linked to a shared pthread
   library or not.  However, these interfaces aren't available in early
   libpthread libraries.  We also need a test that works for archive
   libraries.  We can't use pthread_once as some libc versions call the
   init function.  We also can't use pthread_create or pthread_attr_init
   as these create a thread and thereby prevent changing the default stack
   size.  The function pthread_default_stacksize_np is available in both
   the archive and shared versions of libpthread.   It can be used to
   determine the default pthread stack size.  There is a stub in some
   shared libc versions which returns a zero size if pthreads are not
   active.  We provide an equivalent stub to handle cases where libc
   doesn't provide one.  *//* not __GXX_WEAK__ *//* FreeBSD or Solaris *//* For a program to be multi-threaded the only thing that it certainly must
   be using is pthread_create.  However, there may be other libraries that
   intercept pthread_create with their own definitions to wrap pthreads
   functionality for some purpose.  In those cases, pthread_create being
   defined might not necessarily mean that libpthread is actually linked
   in.

   For the GNU C library, we can use a known internal name.  This is always
   available in the ABI, but no other library would define it.  That is
   ideal, since any public pthread function might be intercepted just as
   pthread_create might be.  __pthread_key_create is an "internal"
   implementation symbol, but it is part of the public exported ABI.  Also,
   it's among the symbols that the static libpthread.a always links in
   whenever pthread_create is used, so there is no danger of a false
   negative result in any statically-linked, multi-threaded program.

   For others, we choose pthread_cancel as a function that seems unlikely
   to be redefined by an interceptor library.  The bionic (Android) C
   library does not provide pthread_cancel, so we do use pthread_create
   there (and interceptor libraries lose).  *//* neither FreeBSD nor Solaris *//* Make sure we'll never enter this block again.  *//* If this really is a threaded program, then we must ensure that
	     __gthread_active has been set to 1 before exiting this block.  *//* This test is not protected to avoid taking a lock on the main code
     path so every update of __gthread_active in a threaded program must
     be atomic with regard to the result of the test.  *//* On Solaris 2.6 up to 9, the libc exposes a POSIX threads interface even if
   -pthreads is not specified.  The functions are dummies and most return an
   error value.  However pthread_once returns 0 without invoking the routine
   it is passed so we cannot pretend that the interface is active if -pthreads
   is not specified.  On Solaris 2.5.1, the interface is not exposed at all so
   we need to play the usual game with weak symbols.  On Solaris 10 and up, a
   working interface is always exposed.  On FreeBSD 6 and later, libc also
   exposes a dummy POSIX threads interface, similar to what Solaris 2.6 up
   to 9 does.  FreeBSD >= 700014 even provides a pthread_cancel stub in libc,
   which means the alternate __gthread_active_p below cannot be used there.  *//* _LIBOBJC || _LIBOBJC_WEAK *//* Objective-C.  *//* Typically, __gthrw_foo is a weak reference to symbol foo.  *//* POSIX like conditional variables are supported.  Please look at comments
   in gthr.h for details. *//* POSIX threads specific definitions.
   Easy, since the interface is just one-to-one mapping.  *//* Copyright (C) 1997-2021 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

   For static libraries it might would work, but as we need to deal

       #define __GTHREADS 1
   to indicate that threads support is present.  Also it has define
   function
     int __gthread_active_p ()
   that returns 1 if thread system is active, 0 if not.

   The threads interface must define the following types:
     __gthread_key_t
     __gthread_once_t
     __gthread_mutex_t
     __gthread_recursive_mutex_t

   The threads interface must define the following macros:

     __GTHREAD_ONCE_INIT
     		to initialize __gthread_once_t
     __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT
     		to initialize __gthread_mutex_t to get a fast
		non-recursive mutex.
     __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT_FUNCTION
		to initialize __gthread_mutex_t to get a fast
		non-recursive mutex.
		Define this to a function which looks like this:
		  void __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT_FUNCTION (__gthread_mutex_t *)
     		Some systems can't initialize a mutex without a
		function call.  Don't define __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT in this case.
     __GTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INIT
     __GTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INIT_FUNCTION
     		as above, but for a recursive mutex.

   The threads interface must define the following static functions:

     int __gthread_once (__gthread_once_t *once, void (*func) ())

     int __gthread_key_create (__gthread_key_t *keyp, void (*dtor) (void *))
     int __gthread_key_delete (__gthread_key_t key)

     void *__gthread_getspecific (__gthread_key_t key)
     int __gthread_setspecific (__gthread_key_t key, const void *ptr)

     int __gthread_mutex_destroy (__gthread_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_destroy (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);

     int __gthread_mutex_lock (__gthread_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_mutex_trylock (__gthread_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_mutex_unlock (__gthread_mutex_t *mutex);

     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_lock (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_trylock (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_unlock (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);

   The following are supported in POSIX threads only. They are required to
   fix a deadlock in static initialization inside libsupc++. The header file
   gthr-posix.h defines a symbol __GTHREAD_HAS_COND to signify that these extra
   features are supported.

   Types:
     __gthread_cond_t

   Macros:
     __GTHREAD_COND_INIT
     __GTHREAD_COND_INIT_FUNCTION

   Interface:
     int __gthread_cond_broadcast (__gthread_cond_t *cond);
     int __gthread_cond_wait (__gthread_cond_t *cond, __gthread_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_cond_wait_recursive (__gthread_cond_t *cond,
					__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);

   All functions returning int should return zero on success or the error
   number.  If the operation is not supported, -1 is returned.

   If the following are also defined, you should
     #define __GTHREADS_CXX0X 1
   to enable the c++0x thread library.

   Types:
     __gthread_t
     __gthread_time_t

   Interface:
     int __gthread_create (__gthread_t *thread, void *(*func) (void*),
                           void *args);
     int __gthread_join (__gthread_t thread, void **value_ptr);
     int __gthread_detach (__gthread_t thread);
     int __gthread_equal (__gthread_t t1, __gthread_t t2);
     __gthread_t __gthread_self (void);
     int __gthread_yield (void);

     int __gthread_mutex_timedlock (__gthread_mutex_t *m,
                                    const __gthread_time_t *abs_timeout);
     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_timedlock (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *m,
                                          const __gthread_time_t *abs_time);

     int __gthread_cond_signal (__gthread_cond_t *cond);
     int __gthread_cond_timedwait (__gthread_cond_t *cond,
                                   __gthread_mutex_t *mutex,
                                   const __gthread_time_t *abs_timeout);

   * @brief  A non-owning observer for a pointer owned by a shared_ptr
   *
   * A weak_ptr provides a safe alternative to a raw pointer when you want
   * a non-owning reference to an object that is managed by a shared_ptr.
   *
   * Unlike a raw pointer, a weak_ptr can be converted to a new shared_ptr
   * that shares ownership with every other shared_ptr that already owns
   * the pointer. In other words you can upgrade from a non-owning "weak"
   * reference to an owning shared_ptr, without having access to any of
   * the existing shared_ptr objects.
   *
   * Also unlike a raw pointer, a weak_ptr does not become "dangling" after
   * the object it points to has been destroyed. Instead, a weak_ptr
   * becomes _expired_ and can no longer be converted to a shared_ptr that
   * owns the freed pointer, so you cannot accidentally access the pointed-to
   * object after it has been destroyed.

   *  @brief  A smart pointer with reference-counted copy semantics.
   *
   * A `shared_ptr` object is either empty or _owns_ a pointer passed
   * to the constructor. Copies of a `shared_ptr` share ownership of
   * the same pointer. When the last `shared_ptr` that owns the pointer
   * is destroyed or reset, the owned pointer is freed (either by `delete`
   * or by invoking a custom deleter that was passed to the constructor).
   *
   * A `shared_ptr` also stores another pointer, which is usually
   * (but not always) the same pointer as it owns. The stored pointer
   * can be retrieved by calling the `get()` member function.
   *
   * The equality and relational operators for `shared_ptr` only compare
   * the stored pointer returned by `get()`, not the owned pointer.
   * To test whether two `shared_ptr` objects share ownership of the same
   * pointer see `std::shared_ptr::owner_before` and `std::owner_less`.

   *  @brief  A simple smart pointer providing strict ownership semantics.
   *
   *  The Standard says:
   *  <pre>
   *  An @c auto_ptr owns the object it holds a pointer to.  Copying
   *  an @c auto_ptr copies the pointer and transfers ownership to the
   *  destination.  If more than one @c auto_ptr owns the same object
   *  at the same time the behavior of the program is undefined.
   *
   *  The uses of @c auto_ptr include providing temporary
   *  exception-safety for dynamically allocated memory, passing
   *  ownership of dynamically allocated memory to a function, and
   *  returning dynamically allocated memory from a function.  @c
   *  auto_ptr does not meet the CopyConstructible and Assignable
   *  requirements for Standard Library <a
   *  href="tables.html#65">container</a> elements and thus
   *  instantiating a Standard Library container with an @c auto_ptr
   *  results in undefined behavior.
   *  </pre>
   *  Quoted from [20.4.5]/3.
   *
   *  Good examples of what can and cannot be done with auto_ptr can
   *  be found in the libstdc++ testsuite.

   take as an argument a handle for the locale which shall be used.  *//* This code is needed for the optimized mapping functions.  *//* Use X/Open or use misc.  *//* These are the same as `toupper' and `tolower' except that they do not
   check the argument for being in the range of a `char'.  *//* Return the part of C that is in the ASCII set

   The declarations here must match those in localeinfo.h.

   In the thread-specific locale model (see `uselocale' in <locale.h>)
   we cannot use global variables for these as was done in the past.
   Instead, the following accessor functions return the address of
   each variable, which is local to the current thread if multithreaded.

   These point into arrays of 384, so they can be indexed by any `unsigned
   char' value [0,255]; by EOF (-1); or by any `signed char' value
   [-128,-1).  ISO C requires that the ctype functions work for `unsigned
   char' values and for EOF; we also support negative `signed char' values
   for broken old programs.  The case conversion arrays are of `int's
   rather than `unsigned char's because tolower (EOF) must be EOF, which
   doesn't fit into an `unsigned char'.  But today more important is that
   the arrays are also used for multi-byte character sets.  *//* ! _ISbit  *//* Alphanumeric.  *//* Punctuation.  *//* Control character.  *//* Blank (usually SPC and TAB).  *//* Graphical.  *//* Printing.  *//* Whitespace.  *//* Hexadecimal numeric.  *//* Numeric.  *//* Alphabetic.  *//* lowercase.  *//* UPPERCASE.  *//* __BYTE_ORDER == __LITTLE_ENDIAN *//* These are all the characteristics of characters.
   If there get to be more than 16 distinct characteristics,
   many things must be changed that use `unsigned short int's.

   The characteristics are stored always in network byte order (big
   endian).  We define the bit value interpretations here dependent on the
   machine's byte order.  *//*

   *
   *  Documentation?  What's that?
   *  Nathan Myers <ncm@cantrip.org>.
   *
   *  A string looks like this:
   *
   *  @code
   *                                        [_Rep]
   *                                        _M_length
   *   [basic_string<char_type>]            _M_capacity
   *   _M_dataplus                          _M_refcount
   *   _M_p ---------------->               unnamed array of char_type
   *  @endcode
   *
   *  Where the _M_p points to the first character in the string, and
   *  you cast it to a pointer-to-_Rep and subtract 1 to get a
   *  pointer to the header.
   *
   *  This approach has the enormous advantage that a string object
   *  requires only one allocation.  All the ugliness is confined
   *  within a single %pair of inline functions, which each compile to
   *  a single @a add instruction: _Rep::_M_data(), and
   *  string::_M_rep(); and the allocation function which gets a
   *  block of raw bytes and with room enough and constructs a _Rep
   *  object at the front.
   *
   *  The reason you want _M_data pointing to the character %array and
   *  not the _Rep is so that the debugger can see the string
   *  contents. (Probably we should add a non-inline member to get
   *  the _Rep for the debugger to use, so users can check the actual
   *  string length.)
   *
   *  Note that the _Rep object is a POD so that you can have a
   *  static <em>empty string</em> _Rep object already @a constructed before
   *  static constructors have run.  The reference-count encoding is
   *  chosen so that a 0 indicates one reference, so you never try to
   *  destroy the empty-string _Rep object.
   *
   *  All but the last paragraph is considered pretty conventional
   *  for a C++ string implementation.

   * @defgroup binary_search_algorithms Binary Search
   * @ingroup sorting_algorithms
   *
   * These algorithms are variations of a classic binary search, and
   * all assume that the sequence being searched is already sorted.
   *
   * The number of comparisons will be logarithmic (and as few as
   * possible).  The number of steps through the sequence will be
   * logarithmic for random-access iterators (e.g., pointers), and
   * linear otherwise.
   *
   * The LWG has passed Defect Report 270, which notes: <em>The
   * proposed resolution reinterprets binary search. Instead of
   * thinking about searching for a value in a sorted range, we view
   * that as an important special case of a more general algorithm:
   * searching for the partition point in a partitioned range.  We
   * also add a guarantee that the old wording did not: we ensure that
   * the upper bound is no earlier than the lower bound, that the pair
   * returned by equal_range is a valid range, and that the first part
   * of that pair is the lower bound.</em>
   *
   * The actual effect of the first sentence is that a comparison
   * functor passed by the user doesn't necessarily need to induce a
   * strict weak ordering relation.  Rather, it partitions the range.

   *
   *  In previous HP/SGI versions of deque, there was an extra template
   *  parameter so users could control the node size.  This extension turned
   *  out to violate the C++ standard (it can be detected using template
   *  template parameters), and it was removed.
   *
   *  Here's how a deque<Tp> manages memory.  Each deque has 4 members:
   *
   *  - Tp**        _M_map
   *  - size_t      _M_map_size
   *  - iterator    _M_start, _M_finish
   *
   *  map_size is at least 8.  %map is an array of map_size
   *  pointers-to-@a nodes.  (The name %map has nothing to do with the
   *  std::map class, and @b nodes should not be confused with
   *  std::list's usage of @a node.)
   *
   *  A @a node has no specific type name as such, but it is referred
   *  to as @a node in this file.  It is a simple array-of-Tp.  If Tp
   *  is very large, there will be one Tp element per node (i.e., an
   *  @a array of one).  For non-huge Tp's, node size is inversely
   *  related to Tp size: the larger the Tp, the fewer Tp's will fit
   *  in a node.  The goal here is to keep the total size of a node
   *  relatively small and constant over different Tp's, to improve
   *  allocator efficiency.
   *
   *  Not every pointer in the %map array will point to a node.  If
   *  the initial number of elements in the deque is small, the
   *  /middle/ %map pointers will be valid, and the ones at the edges
   *  will be unused.  This same situation will arise as the %map
   *  grows: available %map pointers, if any, will be on the ends.  As
   *  new nodes are created, only a subset of the %map's pointers need
   *  to be copied @a outward.
   *
   *  Class invariants:
   * - For any nonsingular iterator i:
   *    - i.node points to a member of the %map array.  (Yes, you read that
   *      correctly:  i.node does not actually point to a node.)  The member of
   *      the %map array is what actually points to the node.
   *    - i.first == *(i.node)    (This points to the node (first Tp element).)
   *    - i.last  == i.first + node_size
   *    - i.cur is a pointer in the range [i.first, i.last).  NOTE:
   *      the implication of this is that i.cur is always a dereferenceable
   *      pointer, even if i is a past-the-end iterator.
   * - Start and Finish are always nonsingular iterators.  NOTE: this
   * means that an empty deque must have one node, a deque with <N
   * elements (where N is the node buffer size) must have one node, a
   * deque with N through (2N-1) elements must have two nodes, etc.
   * - For every node other than start.node and finish.node, every
   * element in the node is an initialized object.  If start.node ==
   * finish.node, then [start.cur, finish.cur) are initialized
   * objects, and the elements outside that range are uninitialized
   * storage.  Otherwise, [start.cur, start.last) and [finish.first,
   * finish.cur) are initialized objects, and [start.first, start.cur)
   * and [finish.cur, finish.last) are uninitialized storage.
   * - [%map, %map + map_size) is a valid, non-empty range.
   * - [start.node, finish.node] is a valid range contained within
   *   [%map, %map + map_size).
   * - A pointer in the range [%map, %map + map_size) points to an allocated
   *   node if and only if the pointer is in the range
   *   [start.node, finish.node].
   *
   *  Here's the magic:  nothing in deque is @b aware of the discontiguous
   *  storage!
   *
   *  The memory setup and layout occurs in the parent, _Base, and the iterator
   *  class is entirely responsible for @a leaping from one node to the next.
   *  All the implementation routines for deque itself work only through the
   *  start and finish iterators.  This keeps the routines simple and sane,
   *  and we can use other standard algorithms as well.

       *  @brief Attempts to insert a std::pair into the %map.
       *  @param  __position  An iterator that serves as a hint as to where the
       *                    pair should be inserted.
       *  @param  __x  Pair to be inserted (see std::make_pair for easy creation
       *               of pairs).
       *  @return An iterator that points to the element with key of
       *           @a __x (may or may not be the %pair passed in).
       *

       *  This function is not concerned about whether the insertion
       *  took place, and thus does not return a boolean like the
       *  single-argument insert() does.  Note that the first
       *  parameter is only a hint and can potentially improve the
       *  performance of the insertion process.  A bad hint would
       *  cause no gains in efficiency.
